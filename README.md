This project is a full stack development of a BMI calculator. It has 4 main parts to it - a front end aspect which has a website design using CSS & HTML, and Javascript for 
user prompting and access, and a back-end design part which focuses on Java and generates a sample workout routine for the user. The design focuses mainly on the BMI prompt and
calculations, however, the workout design is implemented to create a result that benefits the user. A REST API function will be inputted in the future to allow for a more realistic
and complete workout plan, however, the process of that is still being taken underway.
